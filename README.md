# book-organizer
Google workspace addon to aid in organizing a collection of eBooks

## Installation
Copy the source code into a new google workspace project. Easy to follow 
instructions on how to set up such a project can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/cats-quickstart)

## Usage
The add-on helps in keeping a uniform naming convention throughout the eBook library.
It scrapes metadata from ePub and PDF files to aid in the naming process. It also allows
to create a statistics sheet listing all books and folders in your eBook library. 
That sheet can be used to batch update eBooks. Source code for the statistics 
sheet script can be found [here](https://github.com/genosse-c/book-organizer-statistics)
